\section{Strategic Form Games}

\begin{definition}[Strategic Form Game]
	A \textit{strategic form game} consists of:
	\begin{itemize}
		\itemsep0em
		\item Players ${1, \ldots, n}$
		\item For each player $i$, a finite set $S_i$ of strategies
		\item For each player $i$, the function $u_i : S_1 \times \ldots \times
			S_n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ that maps a \textit{strategy profile}
			to a real-numbered payoff to player $i$
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

A \textit{strategy profile} is a vector of strategies that fully specifies all
actions in a game. It must include exactly one strategy for each player. Denote
by $\mathcal{S} = \times_i S_i$ the set of all strategy profiles, that is,
$\mathcal{S}$ is the set of all possible combinations of players' strategies.

\begin{remark}
	Each player's utility function is defined as $u_i : \mathcal{S} \rightarrow
	\mathbb{R}$, and not, say, $u_i : S_i \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$.  That is,
	the payoff to player $i$ depends both on his own strategy and the strategy
	chosen by each other player (if the latter were the case, the game would
	only consist of $n$ separate optimization problems, one for each $i$).
\end{remark}

Playing a game consists of:

\begin{enumerate}
	\itemsep0em
	\item simultaneously\footnote{i.e., players do not know what everyone else
		is doing as they are doing it}, each player $i$ chooses a strategy $s_i
		\in S_i$ that strives to maximise their own utility
		(\textbf{self-interest assumption})
	\item each player $i$ receives utility $u_i(s_1, \ldots, s_n)$
\end{enumerate}

\begin{definition}[Strict dominance]
	A strategy $s \in S_i$ \textit{strictly dominates} another strategy $t \in
	S_i$ if for all strategy profiles $s_{-i} \in S_{-i}$:

	\begin{equation}
		u_i(s_{-i}, s) > u_i(s_{-i}, t)
	\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{fact}
	If strategy profiles $s,t \in S_i$ are such that $s$ strictly dominates $t$
	in game $\Gamma$, then the games $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma \setminus t$ are
	equivalent.
\end{fact}

\begin{definition}[Dominance-solvability]
	A game is \textit{dominance solvable} if Iterated Elimination of Strictly
	Dominated Strategies (IESDS) yields a unique strategy profile (i.e. a $1
	\times 1 \times \ldots$ game).
\end{definition}

\begin{fact}
	The outcome of IESDS is always unique, meaning the order of elimination
	does not matter.
\end{fact}

\begin{fact}
	Not all games are dominance-solvable.
\end{fact}
